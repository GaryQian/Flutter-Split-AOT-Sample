# Defines the feature modules, which dart libraries and assets
# belong in each feature. A dart library must only be included
# in one feature. Any dart library not specified will be included
# in the base module. Assets included in more than one feature
# module will be replicated in each module.
#
# Example:
#
# - name: feature1
#   libraries:
#     - dartlib1
#     - package:yourapp/subdir/libname1.dart
#   assets:
#     - uri/to/assets/*
#     - assets/feature1/*
#     - assets/file_extra_1.png
# - name: feature2
#   libraries:
#     - package:yourapp/subdir/libname2.dart
#   assets:
#     - assets/feature2/*
#     - assets/file_extra_2.png
#
# The default configuration will create a separate module for
# each loading unit produced by the compiler. If this is
# modified, the setup script should be re-run.
