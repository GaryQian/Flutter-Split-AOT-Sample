# In order to prevent unexpected splitting of deferred apps, this golden
# file records the last generated set of loading units. It only possible
# to obtain the final configuration of loading units after compilation is
# complete. This means improperly setup imports can only be detected after
# compilation.
#
# This golden file allows the build tool to detect any changes in the generated
# loading units. During the next build attempt, loading units in this file are
# compared against the newly generated loading units to check for any new or
# removed loading units. In the case where loading units do not match, the build
# will fail and ask the developer to verify that the `deferred-components`
# configuration in `pubspec.yaml` is correct. Developers should make any necessary
# changes to integrate new and changed loading units or remove no longer existing
# loading units from the configuration. The build command should then be
# re-run to continue the build process.
#
# Sometimes, changes to the generated loading units may be unintentional. If
# the list of loading units in this golden is not what is expected, the app's
# deferred imports should be reviewed. Third party plugins and packages may
# also introduce deferred imports that result in unexpected loading units.
#
# This list of loading units are a snapshot of the loading units generated
# by the latest successful gen_snapshot during the assembly of deferred
# components opted-in apps.
